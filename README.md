## EmployeeWise Assignment

### Description
This is a React application that integrates with the Reqres API to perform basic user management functions. The application allows users to log in, view a paginated list of users, and perform edit and delete operations on user data.

### Features
- Authentication: Users can log in with pre-defined credentials.

- User List: After logging in, users can view a paginated list of users.

- Edit User: Users can edit user details, including first name, last name, and email.
  
- Delete User: Users can delete users from the list.

- Error Handling: API errors are handled gracefully, with appropriate messages displayed to the user.

- Responsiveness: The UI is user-friendly and responsive for both desktop and mobile devices.

- Client-side Search functionality: Implemented to filter users based on input.

- React Router: Navigation between the login page, user list, and edit user page.

- Logout Functionality - I have added extra functionality by adding logout option.
